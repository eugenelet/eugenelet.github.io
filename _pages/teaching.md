### Introduction to VLSI Design

**Fall 2019** — Head Teaching Assistant  
_Instructor: Prof. Chen-Yi Lee_

This course conveys junior EE students techniques to analyze and design systems by means of VLSI technology and CAD tools, starting from VLSI process technology and transistor behavior. As Head TA, I led lab sessions, designed assignments, and provided hands-on support for chip design projects using industry-standard CAD tools.

### Integrated Circuit Design Laboratory

**Spring 2018 & Fall 2017** — Head Teaching Assistant / Teaching Assistant  
_Instructor: Prof. Chen-Yi Lee_

This course conveys senior and graduate EE students techniques to design VLSI chips using state-of-the-art CAD tools. In addition to learning CAD tools for performance-driven and cost-effective IC designs, the course addresses top-down design flow and related environments. Responsibilities included supervising chip tapeout projects, debugging student designs, and ensuring students met fabrication deadlines.

### Introduction to Machine Learning

**Spring 2018** — Teaching Assistant  
_Instructor: Prof. Chen-Yi Lee_

This course introduces fundamental concepts and algorithms that enable computers to learn from experience, with an emphasis on their practical application to real problems. I assisted students with implementing neural networks, understanding backpropagation, and applying machine learning techniques to computer vision and signal processing tasks.

## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach emphasizes hands-on learning and bridging theory with practical implementation. I believe in guiding students through the complete development pipeline—from conceptual understanding to working prototypes—while encouraging them to debug their own solutions and develop problem-solving skills that extend beyond the classroom.
