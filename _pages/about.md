Researcher in computer vision and multimodal systems with interests in representation learning, token-efficient VLMs, agentic pipelines, and robust perception for real-world interaction.

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, where I build imaging pipelines for organelle dynamics and explore in-context learning with Large Language Models for biological applications. My recent work spans segmentation, temporal modeling, and unsupervised analysis to accelerate biology workflows.

As the founder of **[Paidge](https://paidge.com)**, I'm building an object-intelligence platform to index physical assets at scale and enable scan-based, conversational interaction. I've completed 3 pilots with museums in the Greater Cincinnati area and maintain a 20+ customer waitlist. The platform leverages a proprietary multi-frame aggregation model on a Perception Encoder with FAISS for efficient instance retrieval, integrated with a lightweight GraphRAG system for high-throughput indexing of millions of objects.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (2023) under Prof. Chen-Yi Lee, where my research focused on efficient deep learning, meta-learning, and resource-constrained neural networks. My work has been published at top-tier venues including CVPR (Oral), ICCV, ECCV, and WACV, with over 400 citations (h-index: 6).

My technical expertise spans PyTorch, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, React, C/C++, CUDA, and deployment infrastructure including AWS, Docker, and mobile platforms (iOS/Android). I'm passionate about bridging cutting-edge research with real-world applications that solve practical problems at scale.
